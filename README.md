## What's in it?
- neovim + deoplete + syntastic + tmux for **[UNIX philosophy compliant development]**
- pyenv + nvm + stack for **sandboxed development in Python, JavaScript and Haskell**
- autojump, autoenv, tig, ranger, fzf, saws, TermFeed and other **cute CLI goodies**


## How can I use it?
Just run the following command if you trust me.

    $ ./install [all | vim | utils | shell]


## Note
- This environment has been tested and used only in OS X / Debian systems.
- Edit your terminal profiles to use installed powerline fonts.
