# dotfiles
My private environment files for UNIX like systems. Supports **OS X / Debian** out of the box.


## What's in it?
- neovim + deoplete + syntastic + tmux for **[UNIX philosophy compliant development]**
- pyenv + nvm + stack for **sandboxed development in python, javascript and haskell**
- autojump, autoenv, tig, ranger, fzf, saws, TermFeed and other **cute cli goodies**


## How can I use it?
Just run the following command if you trust me.

    $ ./install [all | vim | utils | shell]
